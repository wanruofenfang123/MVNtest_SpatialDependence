# MVNtest_SpatialDependence


This repository contains the R codes for the manuscript entitled "Are You All Normal? It Depends!"

The file "Sup_Rcode.R" is a full description of reproducing the simulation studies  presented in the manuscript. 
Specifically, Part 1 shows how to reproduce Figure 1 in the article, and Part 2 shows how to reproduce Figure 2 in the article. 
The file "MVNtest.new.R" contains the code for obtaining the p-value of the new MVN test under spatial dependence, 
while "DHtest.R" is the adapted code to obtain the p-value of test based on Bowman and Shenton (1975) by replacing the estimators
of asymptotic variances in the new test of Equation (11) with un-adjusted variances, 6 and 24, respectively.
