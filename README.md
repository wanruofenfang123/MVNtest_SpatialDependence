# MVNtest_SpatialDependence


This repository contains the R codes for the manuscript entitled "Are You All Normal? It Depends!"

The file "run_Rcode.R" is a full description of reproducing the simulation studies presented in the manuscript. 
Specifically, Part 1 shows how to reproduce Figure 1 in the article, and Part 2 shows how to reproduce Figure 2 in the article. 
The file "univariate_normality_test_spatial.R" contains the code for obtaining the p-value of the univariate normality test for spatial data proposed by Horvath et al. (2020), while "uit.R" is the function to obtain the indicator of whether rejecting (1) or accepting (0) the null hypothesis of multivariate normality using the union-intersection test for spatial data.
